V 0.26

- fuel-saving routing now works as intended, it prefers routes that only take around 70% of the max
  jump distance, but factoring in efficiency (jump distance "wasted" by not doing towards
  the final destination) as well
- fixed a bug that would have the app calculate fuel-saving routes initially even if the checkbox wasn't set

V 0.25a

- fixed an error from manual jump detection that would lead to an infinite rerouting loop 

V 0.25

- Automatic jump detection works again! Thank you, /u/TheShandyMan for the hint
- Standard hotkeyed command changed to F20: Repeat next jump (see V0.19 notes below for more info)
  (The elite-copilot.ini file in which you can set them will be generated the first time you exit the app if you don't have it yet)
  
V 0.21

- Added checkbox for "Economy routing", making routing logic  prefer shorter, more direct jumps
- cleaned up the interface to adjust to new functionality
- speech.ini supports setting the speed of speech (see in the file)

V  0.20

- Speech.ini to set a Voice ID if multiple voices are installed on the sytem (e.g. Ivona, ..)
- Restyling the window to a dark background for less immersion breaking and better Rift readability
- Routing and announcements right after program start with less hiccups

V 0.19

- First version that works around the information about the current system not in netlog.log anymore
- Three hot key - triggered functions are available to do so. 
  You can set those in the elite-copilot.ini and trigger them via Voice Attack, they don't need the app to be in focus 
  - Hotkey_1 (default F20): Confirm you have jumped to the next waypoint in the route
  - Hotkey_2 (default F21): List alternate jumps in case you can't jump to the current waypoint
    (e.g. because of the "incomplete jump target list" bug)
  - Hotkey_3 (default F22): Avoid next waypoint: Make a new route that ignores the next waypoint
    (e.g. because you don't have permission to enter that system)
	
- I'd be happy to hear your feedback. I realize this is far worse than it was before. Sorry.

V 0.18

- Routing won't try to route from an unknown system more than once per session anymore
- Optimization of routing instructions (no "LY until" for unknown systems and more)

V 0.17 alpha2

- fixed a bug that would make routing fail when a default jump distance was used from the .ini file
  (it was being read as text instead of floating point number)


V 0.17 alpha

- Checkbox to turn off announcement of upcoming jumps
- last jump distance is saved to the .ini file and will be used on next program start
- Routing improved, should now find routes where it failed before (if possible at all, of course)
  (Routing logic will now retrace steps in a more robust fashion)
  If your maximum jump distance is low, this should help a lot
- ATTENTION - Routing may be buggy, use previous version in case of problems!

V 0.16

- Dynamic rerouting! If you get lost (aka your current system is not in your route), you'll get a new route
  (check box in the interface to disable it if you don't want that)
- Routing will now announce remaining travel instead of crows distance
- Better announcements of next jumps on new route calculation
- Loading of cached routing data accelerated significantly

V 0.15

- Routing will now announce number of steps and total jump distance
- Routing will use the previously used jump distance instead of the default if none is provided and the user has searched a route since program start

V 0.14

- Route caching enabled, download the neighbor-cache file to speed up routing substantially
- after running the new version, the .ini will have an entry Route_caching=true, set that to false to disable and speed up startup, or just delete/don't download the neighbor-cache file
- several optimizations

V 0.13

- Experimental route finding included
- can use nato spelling for longer star names 
  (seting only in .ini file for now)
- optimized timing for announcements
- will announce remaining distance in LY to target system


V0.11

- Fixed a bug that would use an older netlog files instead of the newest one. It sorted files by filename before, now sorts by creation date.
- Writing the netlog file being looked at in the message window
- Some minor wording changes
