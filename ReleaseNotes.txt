V 0.18

- Routing won't try to route from an unknown system more than once per session anymore
- Optimization of routing instructions (no "LY until" for unknown systems and more)

V 0.17 alpha2

- fixed a bug that would make routing fail when a default jump distance was used from the .ini file
  (it was being read as text instead of floating point number)


V 0.17 alpha

- Checkbox to turn off announcement of upcoming jumps
- last jump distance is saved to the .ini file and will be used on next program start
- Routing improved, should now find routes where it failed before (if possible at all, of course)
  (Routing logic will now retrace steps in a more robust fashion)
  If your maximum jump distance is low, this should help a lot
- ATTENTION - Routing may be buggy, use previous version in case of problems!

V 0.16

- Dynamic rerouting! If you get lost (aka your current system is not in your route), you'll get a new route
  (check box in the interface to disable it if you don't want that)
- Routing will now announce remaining travel instead of crows distance
- Better announcements of next jumps on new route calculation
- Loading of cached routing data accelerated significantly

V 0.15

- Routing will now announce number of steps and total jump distance
- Routing will use the previously used jump distance instead of the default if none is provided and the user has searched a route since program start

V 0.14

- Route caching enabled, download the neighbor-cache file to speed up routing substantially
- after running the new version, the .ini will have an entry Route_caching=true, set that to false to disable and speed up startup, or just delete/don't download the neighbor-cache file
- several optimizations

V 0.13

- Experimental route finding included
- can use nato spelling for longer star names 
  (seting only in .ini file for now)
- optimized timing for announcements
- will announce remaining distance in LY to target system


V0.11

- Fixed a bug that would use an older netlog files instead of the newest one. It sorted files by filename before, now sorts by creation date.
- Writing the netlog file being looked at in the message window
- Some minor wording changes
