V 0.29

- Jump logs now have a timestamp in your local time

- The Copilot will now speak with the first non-Microsoft voice installed in your system
  if you don't have a speech.ini file

- Most speech should be a lot more continous now (but also faster). Download and change speech.ini if you think it's too fast, and le me know what you think!

- Length of the route announced should not include the starting system anymore now, but the actual number of jumps required

- Probably fixed a bug where buttons would be black on some systems

- Might have fixed a  bug with jump distance being too long when entering a distance without decimal point

V 0.28

- New button "Jump log" that will compile and open a log of your previous jumps in notepad
  (Those were, and are still, logged along with all messages in elite-copilot.log)
  There are intermittent timestamps that are written from each time E:Copilot was closed, so you have some reference
  
- Slight rearrangement of UI buttons

- Fixed a bug that would lead to routing to stay "in progress" and halt the app when you are not in a waypoint system and
  rerouting was disabled.

V 0.27

- Selection of From/To systems for route planning via a drop-down-box and changed message accordingly

- Different handling of routing cache, it will always load a cache file on startup if it finds one. This will make startup about
one second longer but speeds up route finding substantially (~3-4x as fast( on longer routes. You need the
neighbor-cache-28.0LY-dump file for this to work. If it's not present, the app will still run as before.

- Routing in "save fuel" mode will announce doing so

- Advise the pilot accordingly when finding a route fails

- "Alternate Jumps" command will now look for jumps of at most 14 LY to work around the "incomplete jump list" bug in E:D

- Ability to set the window to a standard, resizable format via an (undocumented for now) .ini-setting. This won't be standard
for now since it leads to thicker window borders which I find to hurt immersion.
#### Ini setting is: Resizable_window=True ###

- Brighter blue text in the messages (lower) window for better readability

V 0.26

- fuel-saving routing now works as intended, it prefers routes that only take around 70% of the max
  jump distance, but factoring in efficiency (jump distance "wasted" by not doing towards
  the final destination) as well
  (Routing overall isn't perfect yet, but it's pretty close to what good algo's like A* achieve)
- fixed a bug that would have the app calculate fuel-saving routes initially even if the checkbox wasn't set

V 0.25a

- fixed an error from manual jump detection that would lead to an infinite rerouting loop 

V 0.25

- Automatic jump detection works again! Thank you, /u/TheShandyMan for the hint
- Standard hotkeyed command changed to F20: Repeat next jump (see V0.19 notes below for more info)
  (The elite-copilot.ini file in which you can set them will be generated the first time you exit the app if you don't have it yet)
  
V 0.21

- Added checkbox for "Economy routing", making routing logic  prefer shorter, more direct jumps
- cleaned up the interface to adjust to new functionality
- speech.ini supports setting the speed of speech (see in the file)

V  0.20

- Speech.ini to set a Voice ID if multiple voices are installed on the sytem (e.g. Ivona, ..)
- Restyling the window to a dark background for less immersion breaking and better Rift readability
- Routing and announcements right after program start with less hiccups

V 0.19

- First version that works around the information about the current system not in netlog.log anymore
- Three hot key - triggered functions are available to do so. 
  You can set those in the elite-copilot.ini and trigger them via Voice Attack, they don't need the app to be in focus 
  - Hotkey_1 (default F20): Confirm you have jumped to the next waypoint in the route
  - Hotkey_2 (default F21): List alternate jumps in case you can't jump to the current waypoint
    (e.g. because of the "incomplete jump target list" bug)
  - Hotkey_3 (default F22): Avoid next waypoint: Make a new route that ignores the next waypoint
    (e.g. because you don't have permission to enter that system)
	
- I'd be happy to hear your feedback. I realize this is far worse than it was before. Sorry.

V 0.18

- Routing won't try to route from an unknown system more than once per session anymore
- Optimization of routing instructions (no "LY until" for unknown systems and more)

V 0.17 alpha2

- fixed a bug that would make routing fail when a default jump distance was used from the .ini file
  (it was being read as text instead of floating point number)


V 0.17 alpha

- Checkbox to turn off announcement of upcoming jumps
- last jump distance is saved to the .ini file and will be used on next program start
- Routing improved, should now find routes where it failed before (if possible at all, of course)
  (Routing logic will now retrace steps in a more robust fashion)
  If your maximum jump distance is low, this should help a lot
- ATTENTION - Routing may be buggy, use previous version in case of problems!

V 0.16

- Dynamic rerouting! If you get lost (aka your current system is not in your route), you'll get a new route
  (check box in the interface to disable it if you don't want that)
- Routing will now announce remaining travel instead of crows distance
- Better announcements of next jumps on new route calculation
- Loading of cached routing data accelerated significantly

V 0.15

- Routing will now announce number of steps and total jump distance
- Routing will use the previously used jump distance instead of the default if none is provided and the user has searched a route since program start

V 0.14

- Route caching enabled, download the neighbor-cache file to speed up routing substantially
- after running the new version, the .ini will have an entry Route_caching=true, set that to false to disable and speed up startup, or just delete/don't download the neighbor-cache file
- several optimizations

V 0.13

- Experimental route finding included
- can use nato spelling for longer star names 
  (seting only in .ini file for now)
- optimized timing for announcements
- will announce remaining distance in LY to target system


V0.11

- Fixed a bug that would use an older netlog files instead of the newest one. It sorted files by filename before, now sorts by creation date.
- Writing the netlog file being looked at in the message window
- Some minor wording changes
